# Bloglist-frontend
A frontend for the bloglist backend created in part4. 

A login functionnality is implemented for restricting the possibility to view and create blogs only by authenticated users. We assume that a user already exists with the good credentials.

To test the react app unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests with cypress are also implemented.

# Start the application locally
To start an application:

# First, you need to start the backend, to do so, head to part4. Check the README file

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the frontend application
$ npm start

# For running E2E tests
$ npm run cypress:open        # Then, click on run all specs

You can then access the app on : http://localhost:3000
